#My-Mini-Projects

##Description
This project is designed to be a catalog of all of my miniature sized projects such as those in 50 Projects in 50 Days, or smaller ideas I was interested in pursuing at the time.

This catalog makes it not only easier to easily view all of these projects, but also to easily look through smaller features that I have already built before to gain inspiration or incorporate into larger projects I am working on.

All of the projects are built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS, though a handful will include other libraries such as Mark.js.

Many of the 50 Projects in 50 Days projects have been extended with added or reworked functionality. On the main site those are marked with an "*".
